# Elemental names

This web app was inspired by this [code wars kata](https://www.codewars.com/kata/56fa9cd6da8ca623f9001233)

## Functionality

Given a word it uses symbols of elements to construct it, in order, of course. If the given word can be formed by elements it'll show all the ways it can be formed, otherwise, it won't return anything.

For example:

Beach can be formed by the following elements:
  - Be (Beryllium) Ac (Actinium) H (Hydrogen)

Some words, like *snack*, can be formed in several ways:
  - S (Sulfur), N (Nitrogen), Ac (Actinium), K (Potassium)
  - S (Sulfur), Na (Sodium), C (Carbon)m K (Potassium)
  - Sn (Tin), Ac (Actinium), K (Potassium)

You can see the project running on Vercel [here](https://elemental-names.vercel.app/)
